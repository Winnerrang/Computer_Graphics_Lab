# Computer_Graphics_Lab

In every submodule, I implemented the multiple different features in computer graphics. Those implementaiton are implemented using the framework provide by UofT Computer Graphics Course CSC317.

Below are a short description about the features I implemented in each submodule:

**Raster Image**: some imaging processing technique such as such as rgb <-> hsv, demosaic image and gray-scale image etc.

**Ray Casting**: image order rendering technique and some simple intersection test between ray and simple shape(Sphere, triangle, plane etc.).

**Ray Tracing**: Based on the ray casting feature, implement reflection, refraction, and shadow features.

**Bounding Volume Hierarchy**: Implement Object oriented bounding box to solve problems such as whether ray intersect the meshes, find the nearest triangle given a position, find the overlap triangle in two meshes.

**Mesh**: normals in meshes(per-face normal, per-vertex normal, per-corner normal) and Catmull-Clark Subdivison.

**Shader Pipeline**: Using OpenGL to implement features such as perlin noise, bump mapping, and displacement mapping etc.

**Kinematics**: forward&inverse kinematics, linear blend skinning, and keyframe animation.

**Mass Spring Sytem**: fast mass-spring system using sparse matrix.
